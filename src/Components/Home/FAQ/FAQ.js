						<summary>CAN I SUBSTITUTE THIS INGREDIENT?</summary>
						<ul>
							I recommend using the specified ingredients listed
							in the recipe whenever possible for optimal results.
							I understand that you may have dietary restrictions
							or simply do not have a particular ingredient on
							hand, but please remember that by using a
							substitution, I cannot speak for how much this will
							change in the overall taste or texture of the dish
							without further recipe testing.

						<ul>
							Please understand that it is very hard to
							specifically answer this question since I am not in

							recipes that have been successful and well-tested in
							my own kitchen, but I understand that failures and
							mishaps can happen. But with a little bit more
							information, we can troubleshoot what went wrong to
							have a successful turnaround next time.
